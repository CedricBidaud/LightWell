Light Well
============

Last year of IMAC engineer school : Advanced OpenGL project, using light scattering and (alotof) FrameBuffers !

Just run make to compile.

Most important parameter in GUI is "Density" : it sets the delta between two samples of the light scattering.


Inputs :
"i" to display the GUI
"j" to hide interface
"Escape" to close the program
